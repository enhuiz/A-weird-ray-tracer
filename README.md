# A weird ray tracer

![gift](./fig/gift.png)

This is a 🎁 to my friend **Miss Qu** for her 22<sup>nd</sup> lunar birthday 🎉🎉🎉. She said she likes this gift.

Even though she doesn't write code very much, I still want to present her with the code.

Hope she enjoys it!

> P.S.: The idea of this ray tracer is borrowed from [this tutor](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/introduction-to-ray-tracing).
